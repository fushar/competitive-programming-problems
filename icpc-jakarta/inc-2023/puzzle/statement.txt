You love to solve a daily puzzle in a newspaper. In the puzzle, you are given a grid consisting of 2 rows and N columns. Each cell is initially empty (denoted by '.') or blocked (denoted by '#'). Each empty cell can be filled with a letter, either A, B, or C, with the following rules:

- The number of A's is at most Ma.
- The number of B's is at most Mb.
- The number of C's is at most Mc.
- There must be no two cells, each containing A, that share a side (in other words, are vertically or horizontally adjacent).
- There must be no two cells, each containing B, that share a corner (in other words, are diagonally adjacent).

Your final score is calculated as follows: (the number of A's) * Sa + (the number of B's) * Sb + (the number of C's) * Sc.

Given a puzzle, determine the maximum possible score you can obtain.

Constraints
1 <= N <= 1,000
0 <= Ma, Mb, Mc <= 1,000
1 <= Sa, Sb, Sc <= 100,000
Each character in the grid is either '.' or '#'.

Input
N
Ma Mb Mc
Sa Sb Sc
<the grid>

Output
Output the maximum possible score.

Sample Input 1
7
4 4 3
10 30 20
#.#..#.
.#...#.

Sample Output 1
200

Explanation of Sample 1
One possible way to fill the grid that achieves the maximum score is:

#B#CB#B
C#CAB#A

Your score is 2*10 + 4*30 + 3*20 = 20 + 120 + 60 = 200.

Sample Input 2
7
4 4 3
40 20 30
#.#..#.
.#...#.

Sample Input 2
290

Explanation of Sample 2
One possible way to fill the grid that achieves the maximum score is:

#A#AB#C
A#ACB#C

Your score is 4*40 + 2*20 + 3*30 = 160 + 40 + 90 = 290.

Sample Input 3

1 1 1
10 10 10
