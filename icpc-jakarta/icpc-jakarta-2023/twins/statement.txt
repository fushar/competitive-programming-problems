Tale of the Twins

Joko's wife is expecting twins. Her parents proposed two baby names, represented by the strings A and B, each consisting of uppercase letters 'A' to 'Z'.

Joko wants to honor his in-laws' choice, while also having the freedom to choose the names for his twins-to-be. He comes up with the following rule:

- The name for the elder sibling (referred to as A'), must be a permutation of A.
- The name for the younger sibling (referred to as B'), must satisfy:
  * |B'| = |A'|.
  * B' can be obtained by removing zero of more characters from a permutation of B.
  * For each i, B'[i] must be equal to A'[i], or the next letter that follows alphabetically after A'[i].

Joko now wonders, how many different possible pairs of (A', B') are there? As the result might be very large, he is only interested in the result modulo 1,000,000,007.

Constraints

- 1 <= |A| <= |B| <= 100,000.
- A consists of characters 'A'-'Z'.
- B consists of characters 'A'-'Z'.

Output
